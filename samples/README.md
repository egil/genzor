# Genzor Samples

The following samples are available:

1. **GenzorDemo** is a console app that uses Genzor directly to generate files and folders to the file system.
2. **GenzorSourceGeneratorsDemo** is a source generators library that uses Genzor to implement C# source generators.
3. **DemoApp** is an console app that uses the **GenzorSourceGeneratorsDemo** library.

NOTE: All samples currently reference the Genzor package hosted on GitHub Package Repository. To build and try the samples locally, you need to configure your machine to download the Genzor packages. See the section [Getting the Genzor package from GitHub Package Repository](https://github.com/egil/genzor#getting-the-genzor-package-from-github-package-repository) for details on how to do this.
